# Excel tutorials using Building Permit data

Excel is a tool that everyone is familiar with and many people use every day.  This tutorial will show you how you can use Excel to access, analyze, and visualize open government data.  In this series of tutorials, you will learn how to:

1. Access, import, and subscribe to open Dept. of Commerce data, as well as city data.
2. Transform, format and cleanse the data to prepare it for your analysis and/or visualization
3. Record quick macros to automate repetitive tasks
4. Perform visual analysis using the Quick Analysis tools. These will allow you to quickly add visuals like sparklines, charts, data bars, and other tools for analysis right in the worksheet
5.  Query multiple data sets using the built in query tools.  This will allow you to build and record 
queries that can be used over and over again to transform data and form relationships.
6.  Mapping from within excel.  You will build a series of 3D maps to show how geographic data 
changes over time. 
7.  You will then bring in (subscribe to) local city data into the 3D map to drill down into a 
metropolitan area using your data.

While you are free to import the data directly from the Census and City data portals, we are also including sample data files that can be used for 5 years worth of census data.  Each file maps to a year and one of the steps above.  Download the folder to your hard drive for best performance.
